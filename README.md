# Attendance-Automator

Using HTML and CSS to code a website to automate attendance within the Hispanic Student Associations Cabinet members.
Goals:
-Have each member create an account (Name, UFL email, phone number, cabinet, position)
-Have different clearances (HSA President, Secretary, and other Eboard members have power to add/remove events/codes)
-Regular cabinet members can input a unique event code to verify attendance
-Separate option to submit an excuse form 
-Live tracker of 1. Points (Add for each attended event) 2. Excuses submited (Pending approval, approved, denied) 3. Strike removal form (proof of strike removal action) and 4. Current Strike Count 5. Pending strike remvoal requests
